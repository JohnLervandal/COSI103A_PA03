Much of today's software development involves working database-backed responsive interactive web applications. Having an experience modifying such a website using Express/Mongoose/EJS will make it easier to understand similar frameworks and to jump into a full-stack web development project.  Most web apps these days use a front end framework too (e.g. React, ReactNative, Angular), but even these are based on HTML and have a CSS Bootstrap-like styling feature.  Working with this PA will help you on CPA02 where you need to build on this code base and build something interesting demonstrating your mastery of the core full-stack skills and your ability to learn new techniques on your own.
